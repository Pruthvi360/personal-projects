# Operators are the pillar for any language
# Ther operators can be defined as a symbol which is responsible for a particular operation between two operands.
# Example '+' is an operator, to perform addition operations on two operands
# Operands may be values or variables or combination of values and variables
# Python provides a variety of operators described follows

'''
1. Arithmetic operators > provide input as vaule and operations performed on the input values & gives outputs
2. Assignment operators 


3. comparison operators
4. Identity operators  > Takes vaules as input and performs its operation on the input values and gives outputs as 
5. Membership operators  > ALL THIS OPERATORS GIVES OUTPUT AS TRUE OR FALSE

6. logical operators  > provides input as True or False performs operation on it and gives outputs as True or False

7. bitwise operators > takes vaules as input and performs on its binary representation and gives outputs as value.
